//! In-memory, TTL-bounded store for transient OAuth authorization state.
//!
//! The PKCE verifier and CSRF `state` produced by `begin` are single-use and
//! short-lived, so they live only in process memory with a TTL — never in
//! durable secret storage. If the callback never arrives, the entry is evicted
//! when its TTL lapses (no orphaned secret material accumulates).
//!
//! # Deployment constraint: single-instance-only (#4225, open question 1)
//!
//! This store is **process-local**. `begin` and the browser `callback` are
//! separate HTTP requests that may land on **different replicas** in a
//! multi-instance deployment (especially with a BFF relaying the callback) — in
//! which case the replica handling the callback cannot find the pending state
//! written by the replica that handled `begin`, and enrollment fails.
//!
//! Interactive OAuth enrollment therefore currently requires either a
//! **single OAGW instance** or **sticky / state-routed callbacks** (route the
//! callback to the replica that owns the `state`).
//!
//! Lifting this is a future consideration tracked under #4225: a
//! **shared/distributed pending store** (e.g. a TTL-bounded shared cache keyed
//! by `state`), or the **stateless-`state` variant** (open question 3) that
//! encodes the pending authorization into a signed, self-contained `state`
//! parameter so no server-side lookup is needed.
