//! BSS Ledger authorization: PEP resource-type descriptors, action names, the
//! shared [`access_scope`] gate every ctx-bearing service path calls before
//! touching the repository, and the authz-label stub type-schemas registered at
//! gear init so RBAC role-definitions can target the ledger's labels.
//!
//! Nine object-named labels, all OUTSIDE the `gts.cf.resources.*` family — the
//! built-in Reader / Contributor / Owner roles do NOT auto-cover them; access to
//! this finance data requires explicit billing roles:
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.entry.v1~` — journal entries / balances (`post`,
//!   `reverse`, `read`).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.ledger.v1~` — the seller's ledger (`provision` — seed its
//!   chart of accounts, scales, calendar, first period; `read` — list its chart
//!   of accounts).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.fiscal_period.v1~` — a fiscal period (`close`).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.payment.v1~` — a payment (`write` — settle a receipt /
//!   allocate it to receivables; `read` — list a payment's allocations / read the
//!   payer's unallocated pool).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.credit_application.v1~` — a reusable-credit wallet
//!   operation (`write` — grant pool cash into the wallet / apply the wallet to
//!   receivables).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.dispute.v1~` — a chargeback dispute (`write` — record a
//!   dispute phase: open / win / lose).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.dual_control_policy.v1~` — the tenant dual-control
//!   threshold policy (`write` — append an effective-dated version; `read` — the
//!   effective policy).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.recognition.v1~` — ASC 606 revenue recognition (`write` —
//!   trigger a run / change a schedule; `read` — runs / schedules /
//!   disaggregation).
//! - `gts.cf.bss.ledger.reconciliation.v1~` — reconciliation & revenue assurance
//!   (`run` — trigger a check; `resolve` — resolve a close-blocking exception;
//!   `read` — the exception queue / recon runs).
//!
//! Each action sits on its real object (a noun), never an authz tier: the
//! "billing-setup" role grants `provision` + `read` on `ledger` + `close` on
//! `fiscal_period`.
//!
//! The PEP advertises NO tenant-subtree capability (`PolicyEnforcer::new`), so
//! the PDP pre-expands the caller's seller subtree to a flat
//! `AccessScope::In([...])` that SecureORM binds to the `tenant_id` column.
